🎓 I graduated from RMIT University Vietnam with a Bachelor of Business in Economics & Finance, honored to be presented in The Scholar's List of Top 5% for Academic Excellence - Class of 2023.

🔥 After two years of invaluable experience in the Vietnamese Credit industry, I am looking forward to furthering my study in the field of Monetary Economics and Financial Resilience among developing countries.

👨🏾‍🎓 Taking a Pre-master's program in Economics at DEPOCEN, looking for postgraduate studies in Europe, and working real hard to become an Economic Researcher and Lecturer in the future!
